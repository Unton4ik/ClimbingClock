Welcome to the Climbing Clock project!

Here is where we store all our code and code backups.

## Getting Started

Please make sure you read the following to get a grasp on the project.

More importantly, remember to have fun!

## Project Details

**Organisation:** Curtin Robotics Club (CRoC)<br>
**Institute:** Curtin University (Bentley Campus)<br>
**Location:** Ground floor, building  204, Curtin University<br>
**Time:** Most Thursdays 6pm onwards (see CRoC personel for more details)<br>
**Project Lead:** Harrison G. Outram<br>
**Project Founder:** Ilke Dincer<br>
**Difficulty:** Easy to moderate (depends on exact task)

#### Overall Project Goal

To make one or more robots climb in a manner that allows us to tell the time of day.

#### Project Requirements

1. Must be able to tell the time of day within 5 minutes from a distance of up to 10 metres
2. Strict budget to stay under (see Project Lead for more details)
3. Robots must move using internally mechanics (Pulley systems are not allowed)
4. Entire system must hang from second floor catwalk in Engineering Pavilion (building 204). See project lead for exact location
5. Entire system cannot be more than 2.4 metres tall
6. Entire system cannot be more than 1 metre wide
7. System must be able to run automonously (i.e. without supervision)
8. It has to look cool (subject to interpretation)

## Progress Made

As evident by our latest versions and physical devices, we have made several strides into getting our project on track.

However, there is still much more to be done!

Please see our PERT chart (*pending*) and talk with us to get an idea of where you can fit in.

## Prerequisities

While everyone is welcome to join, CRoC has designed this project to be as first-year friendly as possible.
To promote and upload this standard, no experience is necessary to get started!

To get you started, the project lead and your fellow colleagues can teach you all you need to know.
Whether it be learning CAD software or using an Arduino for the first time, feel free to ask anyone anytime if you need help.

Don't worry if your first week or two seemed slow; even the project leads have spent entire build nights just researching how to guides.

## Skills Needed

The Climbing Clock project demands a diverse team of various skillsets to tackle all nuances.

The skillsets can be, somewhat broadly, divided into five categories: -

1. Programming: Using the Arduino IDE or an equivalent to program the system
2. Mechanical: Working within dimensional restrictions and using CAD software to design the robot(s) with moving parts
3. Civil: Designing, CADing, and constructing a structurally stable frame
4. Electronics: Researching and choosing the electronic devices needed for a safe and efficient way of powering the robot(s)
5. Logistics: Managing and researching all equipment and parts needed to build the system while keeping within budget
6. Art: Painting or otherwise colouring the visible parts for visual flare
