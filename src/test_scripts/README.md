# Test Scripts

## Purpose

This directory is for test scripts made by Climbing Clock personnel for Climbing Clock code.

## Standards

For each library, one test script is required.

Each test script must use modern and rigourous test techniques. This includes
1. Boundary Value Analysis
2. Equivelance Partitioning
3. Each path is tested
4. The minimum number of test cases is written to achieve 1-3
5. For each test case, the program outputs to the user whether the test passed or not
   a. If passed, no further info is required
   b. If failed, the expected and actual values must be outputed
6. The test script outputs the number of test cases passed and failed at the end
